  "3:7": "␞P␞And I said after she had committed all these acts of fornication, Turn again to me. Yet she returned not. And faithless Juda saw her faithlessness.",
  "3:8": "␞P␞And I saw that (for all the sins of which she was convicted, wherein the house of Israel committed adultery, and I put her away, and gave into her hands a bill of divorcement,) yet faithless Juda feared not, but went and herself also committed fornication.",
  "3:9": "␞P␞And her fornication was nothing accounted of; and she committed adultery with wood and stone.",
  "3:10": "␞P␞And for all these things faithless Juda turned not to me with all her heart, but falsely.",
  "3:11": "␞P␞And the Lord said to me, Israel has justified himself more than faithless Juda.",
  "3:12": "␞P␞Go and read these words toward the north, and thou shalt say, Return to me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not set my face against you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry with you for ever.",
  "3:13": "␞P␞Nevertheless, know thine iniquity, that thou hast sinned against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every shady tree, but thou didst not hearken to my voice, saith the Lord.",
  "3:14": "␞P␞Turn, ye children that have revolted, saith the Lord; for I will rule over you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you in to Sion:",
  "3:15": "␞P␞and I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they shall certainly tend you with knowledge.",
  "3:16": "␞P␞And it shall come to pass that when ye are multiplied and increased upon the land, saith the Lord, in those days they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Holy One of Israel: it shall not come to mind; it shall not be named; neither shall it be visited; nor shall this be done any more.",
  "3:17": "␞P␞In those days and at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered to it: and they shall not walk any more after the imaginations of their evil heart.",
  "3:18": "␞P␞In those days the house of Juda shall come together to the house of Israel, and they shall come, together, from the land of the north, and from all the countries, to the land, which I caused their fathers to inherit.",
  "3:19": "␞P␞And I said, So be it, Lord, for thou saidst, I will set thee among children, and will give thee a choice land, the inheritance of the Almighty God of the Gentiles: and I said, Ye shall call me Father; and ye shall not turn away from me.",
  "3:20": "␞P␞But as a wife acts treacherously against her husband, so has the house of Israel dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord.",
  "3:21": "␞P␞A voice from the lips was heard, even of weeping and supplication of the children of Israel: for they have dealt unrighteously in their ways, they have forgotten God their Holy One.",
  "3:22": "␞P␞Turn, ye children that are given to turning, and I will heal your bruises. ␞P␞Behold, we will be thy servants; for thou art the Lord our God.",
  "3:23": "␞P␞Truly the hills and the strength of the mountains were a lying refuge: but by the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.",
  "3:24": "␞P␞But shame has consumed the labours of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their calves, and their sons and their daughters.",
  "3:25": "␞P␞We have lain down in our shame, and our disgrace has covered us: because we and our fathers have sinned before our God, from our youth until this day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.",

  "4:10": "␞P␞And I said, O sovereign Lord, verily thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, There shall be peace; whereas behold, the sword has reached even to their soul.",
  "4:11": "␞P␞At that time they shall say to this people and to Jerusalem, There is a spirit of error in the wilderness: the way of the daughter of my people is not to purity, nor to holiness.",
  "4:12": "␞P␞But a spirit of full vengeance shall come upon me; and now I declare my judgments against them.",
  "4:13": "␞P␞Behold, he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are in misery.",
  "4:14": "␞P␞Cleanse thine heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: how long will thy grievous thoughts be within thee?",
  "4:15": "␞P␞For a voice of one publishing from Dan shall come, and trouble out of mount Ephraim shall be heard of.",
  "4:16": "␞P␞Remind ye the nations; behold, they are come: proclaim it in Jerusalem, that bands are approaching from a land afar off, and have uttered their voice against the cities of Juda.",
  "4:17": "␞P␞As keepers of a field, they have surrounded her; because thou, saith the Lord, hast neglected me.",
  "4:18": "␞P␞Thy ways and thy devices have brought these things upon thee; this is thy wickedness, for it is bitter, for it has reached to thy heart.",
  "4:19": "␞P␞I am pained in my bowels, my bowels, and the sensitive powers of my heart; my soul is in great commotion, my heart is torn: I will not be silent, for my soul has heard the sound of a trumpet, the cry of war, and of distress: it calls on destruction;",
  "4:20": "␞P␞for all the land is distressed: suddenly my tabernacle is distressed, my curtains have been rent asunder.",
  "4:21": "␞P␞How long shall I see fugitives, and hear the sound of the trumpet?",
  "4:22": "␞P␞For the princes of my people have not known me, they are foolish and unwise children: they are wise to do evil, but how to do good they have not known.",
  "4:23": "␞P␞I looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was not; and to the sky, and there was no light in it.",
  "4:24": "␞P␞I beheld the mountains, and they trembled, and I saw all the hills in commotion.",

  "4:28": "␞P␞For these things let the earth mourn, and let the sky be dark above: for I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have purposed, and I will not turn back from it.",
  "4:29": "␞P␞The whole land has recoiled from the noise of the horseman and the bent bow; they have gone into the caves, and have hidden themselves in the groves, and have gone up upon the rocks: every city was abandoned, no man dwelt in them.",
  "4:30": "␞P␞And what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, and adorn thyself with golden ornaments; though thou adorn thine eyes with stibium, thy beauty will be in vain: thy lovers have rejected thee, they seek thy life.",
  "4:31": "␞P␞For I have heard thy groaning as the voice of a woman in travail, as of her that brings forth her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion shall fail through weakness, and she shall lose the strength of her hands, saying, Woe is me! for my soul faints because of the slain.",
  "5:1": "␞P␞Run ye about in the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye can find one, if there is any one that does judgment, and seeks faithfulness; and I will pardon them, saith the Lord.",
  "5:2": "␞P␞The Lord lives, they say; do they not therefore swear falsely?",
  "5:3": "␞P␞O Lord, thine eyes are upon faithfulness: thou hast scourged them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them; but they would not receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; and they would not return.",
  "5:4": "␞P␞Then I said, It may be they are poor; for they are weak, for they know not the way of the Lord, or the judgment of God.",
  "5:5": "␞P␞I will go to the rich men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of God: but, behold, with one consent they have broken the yoke, they have burst the bonds.",
  "5:6": "␞P␞Therefore has a lion out of the forest smitten them, and a wolf has destroyed them even to their houses, and a leopard has watched against their cities: all that go forth from them shall be hunted: for they have multiplied their ungodliness, they have strengthened themselves in their revoltings.",
  "5:7": "␞P␞In what way shall I forgive thee for these things? Thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: and I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and lodged in harlots'houses.",
  "5:8": "␞P␞They became as wanton horses: they neighed each one after his neighbour's wife.",
  "5:9": "␞P␞Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this.",
  "5:10": "␞P␞Go up upon her battlements, and break them down; but make not a full end: leave her buttresses; for they are the Lord's.",

  "5:17": "␞P␞and they shall devour your harvest, and your bread; and shall devour your sons, and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep, and your calves, and devour your vineyards, and your fig-plantations, and your olive yards: and they shall utterly destroy your strong cities, wherein ye trusted, with the sword.",
  "5:18": "␞P␞And it shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, that I will not utterly destroy you.",
  "5:19": "␞P␞And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that thou shalt say to them, Because ye served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.",

  "5:22": "␞P␞will ye not be afraid of me? saith the Lord; and will ye not fear before me, who have set the sand for a bound to the sea, as a perpetual ordinance, and it shall not pass it: yea, it shall rage, but not prevail; and its waves shall roar, but not pass over it.",
  "5:23": "␞P␞But this people has a disobedient and rebellious heart; and they have turned aside and gone back:",
  "5:24": "␞P␞and they have not said in their heart, Let us fear now the Lord our God, who gives us the early and latter rain, according to the season of the fulfilment of the ordinance of harvest, and has preserved it for us.",
  "5:25": "␞P␞Your transgressions have turned away these things, and your sins have removed good things from you.",
  "5:26": "␞P␞For among my people were found ungodly men; and they have set snares to destroy men, and have caught them.",
  "5:27": "␞P␞As a snare which has been set is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore have they grown great, and become rich:",
  "5:28": "␞P␞and they have transgressed the rule of judgment; they have not judged the cause of the orphan, nor have they judged the cause of the widow.",
